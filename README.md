Hardware files for the Science Motor Controller (Science MOCO) board <br/>
The entire science system runs off of the 12V 40A auxillary buck from Powerboard. 
Science MOCO disctributes power to the rest of the science system (heater board and science sensors) in addition to driving brushed DC motors, servos, and solenoids.
